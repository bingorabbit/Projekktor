Projekktor is a self-hosted, open source video (and audio) player for the web, written in Javascript, released under GPLv3.
It simplifies the way you implement and work with web video by solving tons of cross browser- and compatibility-issues, adding eye candy and by providing extremely powerful non standard features. With other words: We try to create the best truely free web media player – period.

For technical reasons regarding the new YouTube iFrame API the project's maintainer stopped supporting YouTube issues, so I grabbed the latest working one and added the new controlbar plugin with the new scrubber here.
